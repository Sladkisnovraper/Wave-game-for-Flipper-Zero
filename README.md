# What is this?

This game is almost entirely AI-generated through all circles of hell.

## Gameplay

The logic is simple: the arrow falls down, and when you hold down the **OK** or **UP** button, you start flying up. Avoid obstacles on the way.

## Credits

Inspired by *Geometry Dash* and also by [flipperzero-drifter](https://github.com/jean-edouard/flipperzero-drifter).  
After looking at his code, I finally understood how to build level generation.
